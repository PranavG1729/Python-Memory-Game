# Python-Memory-Game
My first major project! Created using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL.

Followed along the above tutorial for 100 odd lines of code to set up the layout of the cards and defining how the buttons will react upon clicking.

The rest 250+ lines of code (which I wrote on my own) concern:
- Setting up the 7 menu options
- Deciding what happens upon winning the game
- Setting up a timer and resetting it on each try
- Creating and managing a login window using SQL and Tkinter (to open multiple windows using Toplevel class) which includes options to logout, view the leaderboard, delete his/her own score, and generate a strong alphanumeric password.
